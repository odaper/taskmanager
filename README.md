==================================

Basic TODO application,  microservices with node.js, websockets and angular2

ISSUES
======
 - Introduce multi user with roles
 - server.js as .ts 
 - Upgrade to Latest Angular alpha (recurring task)
 - Use mongo from node 
 - Introduce websockets
 - Perhaps introduce CQRS
